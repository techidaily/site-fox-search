## Step-by-Step Tutorial for Downloading and Saving Investopedia Videos as MP4, FLV or Other File Types

### Overview

* I plan to be engaged in investment work in future and so now I am learning some investment courses from Investopedia. One inconvenience is that Investopedia does not allow me to download my purchased course for offline study and it really bothers me. Is there some other methods to download Investopedia online courses for offline purpose? Thanks for your answer.
* I think one financial course is very useful for my speech and I plan to download it and insert one part to my PPT after a little editing. Now the question is how I can download this Investopedia course offline. I can not find any Download button or link on the Investopedia course.

Investopedia is an American website which mainly offers courses for investing and finance education. Investopedia does not offer subscription service and users need to purchase the specific course if they want to watch it. But Investopedia does not allow video download for offline access even if users purchased the course. Still want to download one or many Investopedia courses for offline study or editing? If so, you will need a professional Investopedia downloader to help you.
